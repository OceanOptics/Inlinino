Inlinino is an open-source software data logger for oceanographers. It primarily records measurements from optical instruments deployed on research vessels during month long campaigns. It provides real-time visualization, which helps users troubleshoot instruments in the field and ensure collection of quality data. Inlinino can interface with either analog, serial, USB, or UDP instruments. The data received is logged in a timestamped raw format (as communicated by the instrument) or in a comma separated file (csv) for easy importation in data analysis software. Typically, a new log file is created every hour for simplicity of post-processing and easy backups. Instruments supported are: Sea-Bird Scientific ACS, Sequoia HyperBB, Sequoia LISST100x, SeaBird TSG (SBE-45 + SBE-38), Biospherical Instruments Inc. PAR, Sea-Bird Scientific ECO sensors (e.g. ECO-BB3, ECO-FLBBCD, ECO-BB9), Satlantic (now SBS) instruments (e.g. HyperOCR, HyperPro, HyperSAS, HyperNAV, Suna), NMEA over serial or UDP, analog sensors via data acquisition systems (Ontrak ADU100, DataQ DI-1100, and DI-2108), and peripheral control (e.g. pump, 3-way valves) via relay interface (Ontrak ADU100, ADU200, and ADU208). Other serial instruments with ascii output can be configured with the user interface. Instruments with non-trivial output can be added by writing a dedicated python module.

### Installation
Inlinino was bundled into a Windows executable and a macOS application. Both are available for download with a quick start guide in the [documentation](https://inlinino.readthedocs.io/en/latest/quick_start.html). Otherwise, Inlinino can be installed from source using the setup.py file available on this repository, following the instructions below.

Download Inlinino code.
 
    wget https://github.com/OceanOptics/Inlinino/archive/master.zip
    unzip master.zip
    cd Inlinino-master
 
To install Inlinino (tested with python 3.8 only, should work with newer python versions):

    pip install -r requirements.txt

On Ubuntu, PyQt5 and PyQt5.QtMultimedia should also be installed with apt:

    sudo apt install python3-pyqt5
    sudo apt install python3-pyqt5.qtmultimedia

To use Ontrak ADU on Windows additional dll and python modules are needed. Note that in resources/ontrack the path to the dll need to be edited with `os.path.join(PATH_TO_RESOURCES, 'ontrak', 'AduHid')`.
    
    wget https://www.ontrak.net/images/adu_python_dll.zip
    unzip adu_python_dll.zip
    cp adu_python_dll/ontrak inlinino/ressources
    wget https://www.ontrak.net/images/adu_python_libusb.zip
    unzip adu_python_libusb.zip
    cp adu_python_libusb/libusb/* inlinino/ressources/libusb

To use HydroScat, the Python `aquasense` package is needed. See `README.md` in the [aquasense repository](https://bitbucket.csiro.au/projects/AQRS/repos/aquasense/browse) for installation after cloning https://bitbucket.csiro.au/scm/aqrs/aquasense.git. See also the [CSIRO aquasense record](http://hdl.handle.net/102.100.100/602807?index=1).

Inlinino can then be started from the folder containing inlinino's source code with.

    python -m inlinino

### Inlinino Software
The application is written in PythonÂ 3, on top of pySerial, numpy, and PyQt5. The current version works with a "classic" Graphical User Interface. A web interface started to be implemented and can be found in the branch `tb-app` of this repository. A command line interface used to be available but was not ported to version >2.0.

The code is organized in:
  + `docs`: User Documentation ([ReadTheDocs](https://inlinino.readthedocs.io/))
  + `inlinino`: Inlinino source code
    - `instruments/`:  Instrument interfaces, more instrument types can be added there.
    - `ressources/`: User Interface Layout and Logo.
    - `*.py`: Core code of Inlinino.
    - `inlinino_cfg.json`: Applications parameters are saved in this file ([ReadTheDocs](https://inlinino.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cfg.html))
  + `mcu_firmwares`: Firmwares to upload on a microcontroller for the previous DAQ module (deprecated)
    - `PASC.cpp`: Precision analog to serial converter (PASC) firmware
    - `Simulino.cpp `: Instrument simulator to test Inlinino with microcontrollers simulating the behavior of scientific instruments.
  + `make.py`: Bundles Inlinino application into a .app or .exe depending on platform. pyInstaller must be installed.
  + `setup.py`: Python environment setup file.

When Inlinino is started an engineering log file is created in `logs/inlinino_<YYYYMMDD>_<hhmmss>.log` and keep track of most tasks executed (e.g. user interaction, creation of data log files, warnings, and potential errors).

### Questions and issues
On Ubuntu, one my night need to update the rights to the serial port to let Inlinino read and write from/to them. For example to give right to the serial port `/dev/ttyACM0`:

    sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0
